    <p>
      Raised in a home with over 15 mouths to feed, I quickly found love and a
      gift using my hands to help support the family.
    </p>
    <p>Technology though has always been my dream and passion.</p>
    <p>
      It has helped so many including me to see and reach beyond their current
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the life that they could usually only dream of. I knew I wanted to be a
      part of the force for good for my community, my country, and the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using my knowledge of team building, mission planning, system building,
      and also my thirst for knowledge and self improvement would translate well
      into Tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jumping into Html, CSS, and JavaScript I never looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through my journey at Savvy coders I have gained hands on experience in
      building and deploying SPA's using Netlify. Some other skills I gained
      were Node, MongoDB, Git, Git Bash and many more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm open for opportunities for
      employment, coffee chats, or if you just have a question. Looking forward
      to working with and hearing from you!!
